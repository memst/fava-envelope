    This iterates over all the members of objtuple, skipping the attributes from

    Args:
      objtuple: A tuple object or other.
      ignore: A set of strings, attribute names to be skipped in
        computing a stable hash. For instance, circular references to objects

        unit tests comparing entries coming from different sources as the
